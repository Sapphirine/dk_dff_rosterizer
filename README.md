DraftKings DFF Roster Optimizer

The capability to model future individual player performance and optimize the overall expected points total of a composed Daily Fantasy Football roster is integral to a DFF Manager’s success. While several commercial products and Daily Fantasy Game Websites themselves offer suggested lineups to “optimize” a Manager’s roster, it is unknown whether the supplied data is skewed in favor of the gaming host. DK DFF Rosterizer is an automated roster optimizer using Ridge-Regression analysis and Integer Programming Optimization as an alternative to the projections supplied by DraftKings.
